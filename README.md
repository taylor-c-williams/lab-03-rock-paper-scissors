## Making a plan
1) Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"
2) Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision

    -Semantics/Divs for:
        - Header, rules
        - buttons
        - throw results
        - wins & losses


<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>

        
    - Option radio buttons for:
        -Rock
        -Paper
        -Scissors

    - Play button


5) Is there some state we need to initialize?
    - Wins
    - Losses
    - Draws


6) Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?
    - compares user input to random number (selection)
    - Wins/Losses/Draws

0 = rock
1 = paper
2 = scissors

7) Think about how to validate each of your steps
